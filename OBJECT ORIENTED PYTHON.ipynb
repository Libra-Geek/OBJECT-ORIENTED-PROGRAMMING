    "# INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the previous lessons, we have only used and learnt about Python in the procedural way i.e. **Procedural Programming**. It is time to divert from this and use Python in its true form.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- As a reminder, **Procedural Programming** is only a process of writing codes in a sequential number of steps. This is the way we have written our codes over previous exercises and we make use of functions - in-built or bespoke- to run these commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Object-Oriented Programming** is the new approach we want to employ in using Python. This approach involves us centering our codes around objects. So, instead of assigning our codes to sequential steps and variables, we assign them to objects. We need to know our way around the OOP technique because Python itself is an object-oriented language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- As we continously work with Python, we would encounter objects including NumPy, Pandas, Scikit and Matplotlib. Understanding how these objects work as well as others helps us to better manage the data that we work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Procedural Programming, we assigned our codes to variables which had **types**  namely:\n",
    "            \n",
    "            - String Type\n",
    "            \n",
    "            - List Type\n",
    "            \n",
    "            - Dictionary Type   \n",
    "            \n",
    "            \n",
    "- On the other hand, Object Oriented Programming has objects but these objects are divided into **class** instead of types which are:\n",
    "\n",
    "            - String Class\n",
    "            \n",
    "            - List Class\n",
    "            \n",
    "            - Dictionary Class\n",
    "\n",
    "- A class refers to a set of similar objects and they are used more formally in Object Oriented Programming. Recall that in Procedural programming, the function `type` was used to return the nature of the codes which had been passed to assigned variables. Thus, we must bear in mind that *class* and *type* are used interchangeably."

    "            \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A way to understand this is to compare real-world objects. Let us compare Tesla electric cars:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - There are hundreds of thousands of Tesla cars around the world. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Each car is similar in that it is a Tesla — it's not a Ford or Toyota — but at the same time, it is not necessarily identical to other Teslas. We would say that each of the cars are objects that belong to the Tesla class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Tesla has a blueprint — or plan — for making their cars. The blueprint defines what the car is, what it does, and how — everything that makes the car unique. \n",
    "      \n",
    "    - That said, the blueprint isn't a car, it's just all the information needed to create the car. Similarly, in Python, we have code blueprints for classes. These blueprints are **class definitions**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- It is necessary that we learn how to create class definitions. To do this, we apply the same approach used for creating functions. We define the function with brackets and a colon and the rest follows. Kindly note that the **rules for creating functions** also apply when we are naming classes. These rules are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - We must use only letters, numbers, or underscores.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - We cannot use apostrophes, hyphens, whitespace characters, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Class names can't start with a number. \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- When creating functions under variables, there is a convention with lettes as we use what is called the **Snake Case** when naming our function. This is shown as: \"name_function\". With this convention, all lowercase letters are separated using underscores.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the other hand, for OOP, we are required to use the **Pascal Case** when creating our class definitions. This is depicted as: \"NameFunction\" where the words start with an initial capitalization and they are rather joined together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- However, if we create functions or class definitions without filling the blocks with inputs, we would end up with a `Syntax Error`. We want to avoid this, so, we would use the Python function `pass()` which will follow the name of the function and help avoid the error. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `pass` statement is useful when we are writing complex codes and we want to create a placeholder for a function which we intend to build later without causing a code error.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",

    "- **Instantiation** refers to the process of creating an object of a particular class once we have identified the particular class we are dealing with. So, when we create an object of a particular class, we could say that we **instantiate** an object of that class.
